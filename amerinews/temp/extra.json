    "title": "'Very Much Alive': Joe Biden Projected To Win South Carolina",
    "content": "This result totally resets the race. The fact that Joe Biden won big — and the result was clear early in the evening during prime time in the eastern time zone — provides an enormous boost to his campaign. If Joe Biden can ultimately defeat Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination, we will look back on this night as a key moment in American political history,\" Republican strategist Whit Ayres told NPR. A majority of Democratic primary voters in South Carolina are African American. And pointing to polls, Biden has long insisted that he has more support from black voters than any other presidential candidate does and that the Democratic nominee will need strong backing from African American voters to win the general election. Biden's win was not a surprise. For months, polls had shown him with a double-digit lead over his opponents, but in recent weeks, the race tightened. In a sign of how vulnerable he was, Biden campaigned exclusively in South Carolina this week, even as a number of his opponents traveled to states that will vote in coming days. Biden also received a last-minute public endorsement from the most influential black Democrat in South Carolina politics, U.S. Rep. James Clyburn. \"I've known for a long time who I was going to vote for,\" Clyburn said at a press conference on Wednesday. \"I'm voting for Biden. South Carolinians should be voting for Joe Biden.\" Biden made a point to credit the congressman with injecting his campaign with a huge jolt at his post-vote event: \"My buddy Jim Clyburn — you brought me back!\""
